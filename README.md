Tezos Link is a gateway to access to the Tezos network aiming to improve developer experience when you are developping Tezos applications.

The project is hosted in Amazon Web Service by [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com/) and is under the supervision of the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/).

## How to start using Tezos-Link

The [Tezos Link website](https://tezoslink.io/) contains all the informations needed to use it.

We invite you to have a look to our [documentation](https://tezoslink.io/documentation) to learn how to use the API.

You don't know how to code a Tezos Smart Contract ? Feel free to check [Tezos Academy](https://tezosacademy.io). It contains all the assets you need to learn Smart Contract development... and for free.

## How it works

The TezosLink project was builded to be run on an AWS architecture.
It is mainly composed by a group of Tezos nodes from differents Tezos networks which are running next to a proxy. This proxy redirect smartly requests based on the request type and few other factors.

If you want to get more informations, have a look to our [technical documentation](./docs).
